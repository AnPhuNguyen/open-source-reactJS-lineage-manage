- red button / xóa thành viên: delete member from lineage after selecting the element that hold such person
- blue button / thiết lập mối quan hệ: create relationship between 2 person. WITH some sane restriction
- cyan button / xem mối quan hệ: view created relationship,  have option to delete them. (I want to draw lines for relationships for visual purpose but dont know how)
